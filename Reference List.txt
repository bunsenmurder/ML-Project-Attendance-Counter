With the vec issues:
I used the 3rd link the in reference list folder, as well as the other below as I had trouble with the vec files. I figured out that due to corrupt images in the neg directory that I could not completly train everything even with the script. I created a script to check the folder for corrupt images, I then removed those corrupt images.
